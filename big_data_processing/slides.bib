  abstract = {"As an author, editor, and publisher, I never paid much attention to the competition--except in a few cases. This is one of those cases. The UNIX System Administration Handbook is one of the few books we ever measured ourselves against."--Tim O'Reilly, founder of O'Reilly Media "This edition is for those whose systems live in the cloud or in virtualized data centers; those whose administrative work largely takes the form of automation and configuration source code; those who collaborate closely with developers, network engineers, compliance officers, and all the other worker bees who inhabit the modern hive." --Paul Vixie, Internet Hall of Fame-recognized innovator and founder of ISC and Farsight Security "This book is fun and functional as a desktop reference. If you use UNIX and Linux systems, you need this book in your short-reach library. It covers a bit of the systems' history but doesn't bloviate. It's just straight-forward information delivered in a colorful and memorable fashion." --Jason A. Nunnelley UNIX{\textregistered} and Linux{\textregistered} System Administration Handbook, Fifth Edition, is today's definitive guide to installing, configuring, and maintaining any UNIX or Linux system, including systems that supply core Internet and cloud infrastructure. Updated for new distributions and cloud environments, this comprehensive guide covers best practices for every facet of system administration, including storage management, network design and administration, security, web hosting, automation, configuration management, performance analysis, virtualization, DNS, security, and the management of IT service organizations. The authors--world-class, hands-on technologists--offer indispensable new coverage of cloud platforms, the DevOps philosophy, continuous deployment, containerization, monitoring, and many other essential topics. Whatever your role in running systems and networks built on UNIX or Linux, this conversational, well-written guide will improve your efficiency and help solve your knottiest problems},
