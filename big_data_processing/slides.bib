  abstract = {"As an author, editor, and publisher, I never paid much attention to the competition--except in a few cases. This is one of those cases. The UNIX System Administration Handbook is one of the few books we ever measured ourselves against."--Tim O'Reilly, founder of O'Reilly Media "This edition is for those whose systems live in the cloud or in virtualized data centers; those whose administrative work largely takes the form of automation and configuration source code; those who collaborate closely with developers, network engineers, compliance officers, and all the other worker bees who inhabit the modern hive." --Paul Vixie, Internet Hall of Fame-recognized innovator and founder of ISC and Farsight Security "This book is fun and functional as a desktop reference. If you use UNIX and Linux systems, you need this book in your short-reach library. It covers a bit of the systems' history but doesn't bloviate. It's just straight-forward information delivered in a colorful and memorable fashion." --Jason A. Nunnelley UNIX{\textregistered} and Linux{\textregistered} System Administration Handbook, Fifth Edition, is today's definitive guide to installing, configuring, and maintaining any UNIX or Linux system, including systems that supply core Internet and cloud infrastructure.
