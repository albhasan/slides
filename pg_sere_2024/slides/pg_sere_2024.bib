  abstract = {Identifying forest degradation is as import as identifying deforestation, but even more challenging. Due to the role of tropical forests in the Earth System, it is imperative to discover new ways to improve and characterize our knowledge about forest degradation. This includes finding alternative uses for already existing data such as the warnings issued by the DETER system. In this paper, we explore the DETER warnings in S{\~a}o F{\'e}lix do Xingu from 2016 to 2021 and compute their frequency over the same areas. We found forest areas with up to 4 warnings 4 years apart and their mean time between the first and second warnings is two years and one year between the second and the third. Our results are important because they point to DETER as a source of data for analyzing the development of deforestation by recurrent degradation.},
