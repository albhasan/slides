  abstract = {Exceptional fire activity in 2019 sparked concern about Amazon forest conservation. However, the inability to rapidly separate satellite fire detections by fire type hampered fire suppression and assessment of ecosystem and air quality impacts. Here, we describe the development of a near\textendash real-time approach for tracking contributions from deforestation, forest, agricultural, and savanna fires to burned area and emissions and apply the approach to the 2019 fire season in South America. Across the southern Amazon, 19,700 deforestation fire events accounted for 39\% of all satellite active fire detections and the majority of fire carbon emissions (63\%; 69 Tg C). Multiday fires accounted for 81\% of burned area and 92\% of carbon emissions from the Amazon, with many forest fires burning uncontrolled for weeks. Most fire detections from deforestation fires were correctly identified within 2 days (67\%), highlighting the potential to improve situational awareness and management outcomes during fire emergencies.           ,              Near\textendash real-time tracking of individual fires can distinguish fire types to support rapid responses to Amazon fire emergencies.},

A recent satellite analysis of the Amazon basin suggests this might happen first in floodplains where forests are particularly fragile. We studied floodplain landscapes of the middle Rio Negro, covering\,\textasciitilde\,4100~km               2               at the Central Amazon region, where forest ecosystems are dominant. We used Landsat images to map 40~years of wildfire history and test the hypothesis that repeatedly burnt forests fail to regenerate and can be replaced by white-sand savanna ecosystems. In the field, using a chronosequence of `time after the first fire', we assessed changes in tree species composition, herbaceous cover and topsoil properties. Here we show that when these forests are repeatedly disturbed by wildfires, their soil gradually loses clay and nutrients and becomes increasingly sandy. In synchrony, native herbaceous cover expands, forest tree species disappear and white-sand savanna tree species become dominant. This drastic ecosystem shift happened within 40~years, likely accelerated by topsoil erosion. When recurrent fires maintain floodplain forests in an open vegetation state, topsoil erosion intensifies, transforming clay-rich soils into white-sand soils that may favour savanna tree species. Our findings reveal that white-sand savannas may expand through seasonally flooded ecosystems at the core of the Amazon, facilitated by wildfires.},

  abstract = {With deforestation and associated fires ongoing at high rates, and amidst urgent need to preserve Amazonia, improving the understanding of biomass burning emissions drivers is essential. The use of orbital remote sensing data enables the estimate of both biomass burning emissions and deforestation. In this study, we have estimated emissions of particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 \textmu m (PM2.5) associated with biomass burning, a primary human health risk, using the Brazilian Biomass Burning emission model with Fire Radiative Power (3BEM\_FRP), and estimated deforestation based on the MapBiomas dataset. Using these estimates, we have assessed for the first time how deforestation drove biomass burning emissions in Amazonia over the last two decades at three scales of analysis: Amazonia-wide, country/state and pixel. Amazonia accounted for 48\% of PM2.5 emitted from biomass burning in South America and current deforestation rates have reached values on par with those of the early 21st Century. Emissions and deforestation were concentrated in the Eastern and Central-Southern portions of Amazonia. Amazonia-wide deforestation and emissions were linked through time (R = 0.65). Countries/states with the widest spread agriculture were less likely to be correlated at this scale, likely because of the importance of biomass burning in agricultural practices. Concentrated in regions of ongoing deforestation, in 18\% of Amazonia grid cells PM2.5 emissions associated with biomass burning and deforestation were significantly positively correlated. Deforestation is an important driver of emissions in Amazonia but does not explain biomass burning alone. Therefore, future work must link climate and other non-deforestation drivers to completely understand biomass burning emissions in Amazonia. The advance of anthropogenic activities over forested areas, which ultimately leads to more fires and deforestation, is expected to continue, worsening a crisis of dangerous emissions.},

Deforestation rates continue ascending, reaching in 2021 the highest value since 2006 (13,235 km2). To overcome this paradox, strategies to curb deforestation are mandatory. The current strategy, ``Plano Amaz\^onia 21/22,'' prioritizes law enforcement actions to curb illegal deforestation in only 11 Amazonian municipalities. Here, we show that this prioritization is likely to be insufficient since these municipalities account for just 37\% of the current deforestation rate. This strategy may also be undermined by the leakage of deforestation actions to unmonitored municipalities. Using a set of spatially explicit datasets integrated into a deforestation-prediction modeling approach, we propose a science-based alternative method for ranking deforestation hotspots to be prioritized by law enforcement actions. Our prioritization method accounts for more than 60\% of the deforestation, detecting larger deforested areas in both private and public lands, while covering 27\% less territory than ``Plano Amaz\^onia 21/22.'' Optimizing the detection of priority areas for curbing deforestation, as proposed here, is the first step to reducing deforestation rates and comply with the Brazilian legal commitment of 3925 km2 year-1.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Fires associated with land use and land cover changes release into the atmosphere large amounts of aerosols and trace gases. Although there are several inventories of biomass burning emissions covering Brazil, there are still considerable uncertainties and differences among these. While most fire emissions inventories still utilize the parameters of vegetation fuel load, emission factors and other parameters to estimate the biomass burned and its associated emissions, certain more recent inventories tend to apply an alternative method based on fire radiative power (FRP) observations to estimate the amount of biomass burned and the corresponding emissions of trace gases and aerosols. The Brazilian Biomass Burning Emission Model (3BEM) and Fire Inventory from NCAR (FINN) are examples of the first, while Brazilian Biomass Burning Emission Model with FRP assimilation (3BEM\_FRP) and Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS) are examples of the latter method mentioned. In this paper, the output of four biomass burning emission inventories used during the South American Biomass Burning Analysis (SAMBBA) field campaign are analyzed and intercompared, focusing on eight predefined grids. Aerosol optical thickness derived from measurements made by the MODIS sensor operating onboard the Aqua satellite is applied to assess the inventories consistency. Significant correlation coefficients (r, p{$>$}0.05 level, Student t-test) were found between 3BEM and FINN, and between 3BEM\_FRP and GFAS, with approximately 0.86 and 0.85, respectively. These results indicate that emissions estimates in this region derived via similar methods tend to agree with one other, but differ more from the estimates derived via the alternative approach. However, correlations in specific grids indicate that 3BEM and FINN typically underestimated the smoke emission loading in the eastern region of Amazon Forest, whilst 3BEM\_FRP presents a tendency to overestimate fire emissions in the same area. The relationship between the 3BEM and FINN fire inventories present a correlation coefficient of 0.75-0.92, with a tendency of FINN to overestimate the emission of carbon monoxide by 20-30\%. Moreover, 3BEM and GFAS shows a correlation coefficient of between 0.75-0.85, with higher values near the arc of deforestation in Amazon Rainforest. However, GFAS has a tendency to present higher carbon monoxide emissions in this region, and 3BEM\_FRP tends to overestimate the emissions in soybean expansion (east of Amazon forest).},

In order to evaluate the proposed method a test site was selected covering a Landsat ETM+ scene (227/68) located in Mato Grosso State. For this purpose a multitemporal series of MODIS surface reflectance images (MOD09) and the corresponding ETM+ images from June to October 2002 were analyzed. It was found that small deforested areas (lower than 15 ha) were detected by MODIS images with lower accuracy when compared with ETM+ images. As the deforested areas increase MODIS and ETM+ results tend to converge. This procedure showed to be adequate to operationally detect and monitor deforested areas and has been used since 2004 as part of a government plan to control the Amazon deforestation.},

  abstract = {Quantifying forest fires remain a challenging task for the implementation of public policies aimed to mitigate climate change. In this paper, we propose a new method to provide an annual burned area map of Mato Grosso State located in the Brazilian Amazon region, taking advantage of the high spatial and temporal resolution sensors. The method consists of generating the vegetation, soil, and shade fraction images by applying the Linear Spectral Mixing Model (LSMM) to the Landsat-8 OLI (Operational Land Imager), PROBA-V (Project for On-Board Autonomy\textendash Vegetation), and Suomi NPP-VIIRS (National Polar-Orbiting Partnership-Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) datasets. The shade fraction images highlight the burned areas, in which values are represented by low reflectance of ground targets, and the mapping was performed using an unsupervised classifier. Burned areas were evaluated in terms of land use and land cover classes over the Amazon, Cerrado and Pantanal biomes in the Mato Grosso State. Our results showed that most of the burned areas occurred in non-forested areas (66.57\%) and old deforestation (21.54\%). However, burned areas over forestlands (11.03\%), causing forest degradation, reached more than double compared with burned areas identified in consolidated croplands (5.32\%). The results obtained were validated using the Sentinel-2 data and compared with active fire data and existing global burned areas products, such as the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer product) MCD64A1 and MCD45A1, and Fire CCI (ESA Climate Change Initiative) products. Although there is a good visual agreement among the analyzed products, the areas estimated were quite different. Our results presented correlation of 51\% with Sentinel-2 and agreement of r2 = 0.31, r2 = 0.29, and r2 = 0.43 with MCD64A1, MCD45A1, and Fire CCI products, respectively. However, considering the active fire data, it was achieved the better performance between active fire presence and burn mapping (92\%). The proposed method provided a general perspective about the patterns of fire in various biomes of Mato Grosso State, Brazil, that are important for the environmental studies, specially related to fire severity, regeneration, and greenhouse gas emissions.},

Previous work has assessed the impacts of tropical deforestation on precipitation, but these efforts have been largely limited to case studies               2               . A wider analysis of interactions between deforestation and precipitation\textemdash and especially how any such interactions might vary across spatial scales\textemdash is lacking. Here we show reduced precipitation over deforested regions across the tropics. Our results arise from a pan-tropical assessment of the impacts of 2003\textendash 2017 forest loss on precipitation using satellite, station-based and reanalysis datasets. The effect of deforestation on precipitation increased at larger scales, with satellite datasets showing that forest loss caused robust reductions in precipitation at scales greater than 50\,km. The greatest declines in precipitation occurred at 200\,km, the largest scale we explored, for which 1 percentage point of forest loss reduced precipitation by 0.25\,{$\pm$}\,0.1\,mm per month. Reanalysis and station-based products disagree on the direction of precipitation responses to forest loss, which we attribute to sparse in situ tropical measurements. We estimate that future deforestation in the Congo will reduce local precipitation by 8\textendash 10\% in 2100. Our findings provide a compelling argument for tropical forest conservation to support regional climate resilience.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The impact of biomass burning aerosol (BBA) on the regional climate in South America is assessed using 30-year simulations with a global atmosphere-only configuration of the Met Office Unified Model. We compare two simulations of high and low emissions of biomass burning aerosol based on realistic interannual variability. The aerosol scheme in the model has hygroscopic growth and optical properties for BBA informed by recent observations, including those from the recent South American Biomass Burning Analysis (SAMBBA) intensive aircraft observations made during September 2012. We find that the difference in the September (peak biomass emissions month) BBA optical depth between a simulation with high emissions and a simulation with low emissions corresponds well to the difference in the BBA emissions between the two simulations, with a 71.6\,\% reduction from high to low emissions for both the BBA emissions and the BB AOD in the region with maximum emissions (defined by a box of extent 5\textendash 25{$\circ$}\,S, 40\textendash 70{$\circ$}\,W, used for calculating mean values given below). The cloud cover at all altitudes in the region of greatest BBA difference is reduced as a result of the semi-direct effect, by heating of the atmosphere by the BBA and changes in the atmospheric stability and surface fluxes. Within the BBA layer the cloud is reduced by burn-off, while the higher cloud changes appear to be responding to stability changes. The boundary layer is reduced in height and stabilized by increased BBA, resulting in reduced deep convection and reduced cloud cover at heights of 9\textendash 14\,km, above the layer of BBA. Despite the decrease in cloud fraction, September downwelling clear-sky and all-sky shortwave radiation at the surface is reduced for higher emissions by 13.77\,{$\pm$}\,0.39\,W\,m-2 (clear-sky) and 7.37\,{$\pm$}\,2.29\,W\,m-2 (all-sky), whilst the upwelling shortwave radiation at the top of atmosphere is increased in clear sky by 3.32\,{$\pm$}\,0.09 W\,m-2, but decreased by -1.36{$\pm$}1.67\,W\,m-2 when cloud changes are included. Shortwave heating rates increase in the aerosol layer by 18\,\% in the high emissions case. The mean surface temperature is reduced by 0.14\,{$\pm$}\,0.24\,{$\circ$}C and mean precipitation is reduced by 14.5\,\% in the peak biomass region due to both changes in cloud cover and cloud microphysical properties. If the increase in BBA occurs in a particularly dry year, the resulting reduction in precipitation may exacerbate the drought. The position of the South Atlantic high pressure is slightly altered by the presence of increased BBA, and the strength of the southward low-level jet to the east of the Andes is increased. There is some evidence that some impacts of increased BBA persist through the transition into the monsoon, particularly in precipitation, but the differences are only statistically significant in some small regions in November. This study therefore provides an insight into how variability in deforestation, realized through variability in biomass burning emissions, may contribute to the South American climate, and consequently on the possible impacts of future changes in BBA emissions.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Climate, land use, and other anthropogenic and natural drivers have the potential to influence fire dynamics in many regions. To develop a mechanistic understanding of the changing role of these drivers and their impact on atmospheric composition, long-term fire records are needed that fuse information from different satellite and in situ data streams. Here we describe the fourth version of the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED) and quantify global fire emissions patterns during 1997\textendash 2016. The modeling system, based on the Carnegie\textendash Ames\textendash Stanford Approach (CASA) biogeochemical model, has several modifications from the previous version and uses higher quality input datasets. Significant upgrades include (1)~new burned area estimates with contributions from small fires, (2)~a revised fuel consumption parameterization optimized using field observations, (3)~modifications that improve the representation of fuel consumption in frequently burning landscapes, and (4)~fire severity estimates that better represent continental differences in burning processes across boreal regions of North America and Eurasia. The new version has a higher spatial resolution (0.25\textdegree ) and uses a different set of emission factors that separately resolves trace gas and aerosol emissions from temperate and boreal forest ecosystems. Global mean carbon emissions using the burned area dataset with small fires (GFED4s) were 2.2\,\,\texttimes\,\,1015~grams of carbon per year (Pg\,C\,yr-1) during 1997\textendash 2016, with a maximum in 1997 (3.0\,Pg\,C\,yr-1) and minimum in 2013 (1.8\,Pg\,C\,yr-1). These estimates were 11\,\% higher than our previous estimates (GFED3) during 1997\textendash 2011, when the two datasets overlapped. This net increase was the result of a substantial increase in burned area (37\,\%), mostly due to the inclusion of small fires, and a modest decrease in mean fuel consumption (-19\,\%) to better match estimates from field studies, primarily in savannas and grasslands. For trace gas and aerosol emissions, differences between GFED4s and GFED3 were often larger due to the use of revised emission factors. If small fire burned area was excluded (GFED4 without the s for small fires), average emissions were 1.5\,Pg\,C\,yr-1. The addition of small fires had the largest impact on emissions in temperate North America, Central America, Europe, and temperate Asia. This small fire layer carries substantial uncertainties; improving these estimates will require use of new burned area products derived from high-resolution satellite imagery. Our revised dataset provides an internally consistent set of burned area and emissions that may contribute to a better understanding of multi-decadal changes in fire dynamics and their impact on the Earth system.

  abstract = {Abstract                            Globally, fires are a major source of carbon from the terrestrial biosphere to the atmosphere, occurring on a seasonal cycle and with substantial interannual variability. To understand past trends and variability in sources and sinks of terrestrial carbon, we need quantitative estimates of global fire distributions. Here we introduce an updated version of the Fire Including Natural and Agricultural Lands model, version 2 (FINAL.2), modified to include multiday burning and enhanced fire spread rate in forest crowns. We demonstrate that the improved model reproduces the interannual variability and spatial distribution of fire emissions reported in present-day remotely sensed inventories. We use FINAL.2 to simulate historical (post-1700) fires and attribute past fire trends and variability to individual drivers: land use and land cover change, population growth, and lightning variability. Global fire emissions of carbon increase by about 10\% between 1700 and 1900, reaching a maximum of 3.4~Pg~C~yr               -1               in the 1910s, followed by a decrease to about 5\% below year 1700 levels by 2010. The decrease in emissions from the 1910s to the present day is driven mainly by land use change, with a smaller contribution from increased fire suppression due to increased human population and is largest in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Interannual variability of global fire emissions is similar in the present day as in the early historical period, but present-day wildfires would be more variable in the absence of land use change.                        ,              Key Points                                                                The introduction of multiday burning into the model increases model fire interannual variability                                                     Historical land use change increases area burned but decreases fire emissions                                                     Recent land use change led to decreased global wildfire interannual variability},
