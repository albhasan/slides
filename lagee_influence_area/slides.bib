  abstract = {Aircraft atmospheric profiling is a valuable technique for determining greenhouse gas fluxes at regional scales (104--106 km2). Here, we describe a new, simple method for estimating the surface influence of air samples that uses backward trajectories based on the Lagrangian model Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory Model (HYSPLIT). We determined ``regions of influence'' on a quarterly basis between 2010 and 2018 for four aircraft vertical profile sites: SAN and ALF in the eastern Amazon, and RBA and TAB or TEF in the western Amazon. We evaluated regions of influence in terms of their relative sensitivity to areas inside and outside the Amazon and their total area inside the Amazon. Regions of influence varied by quarter and less so by year. In the first and fourth quarters, the contribution of the region of influence inside the Amazon was 83--93\% for all sites, while in the second and third quarters, it was 57--75\%. The interquarter differences are more evident in the eastern than in the western Amazon. Our analysis indicates that atmospheric profiles from the western sites are sensitive to 42--52.2\% of the Amazon. In contrast, eastern Amazon sites are sensitive to only 10.9--25.3\%. These results may help to spatially resolve the response of greenhouse gas emissions to climate variability over Amazon.},

  abstract = {We present an analysis framework and illustrate its potential to constrain terrestrial carbon fluxes at the regional scale using observations of CO               2               and CO over North America acquired during the CO               2               Budget and Rectification Airborne (COBRA) study in 2000. The COBRA data set, presented in detail in a companion paper [                                Gerbig et al.                 , 2003                              ] provides dense spatial coverage and extensive profiling in the lower atmosphere, revealing strong CO               2               signatures of land surface fluxes in the active and relic mixed layers of the atmosphere. We introduce a ``receptor-oriented'' analysis framework designed to quantitatively interpret the atmospheric signatures of surface processes by linking concentrations at measurement locations (receptors) to surface fluxes in upwind regions. The framework incorporates three main components: (1) the Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport (STILT) model, driven with assimilated winds and running backward in time to map out the source-receptor relationship (footprint) at high temporal and spatial resolution; (2) an observation-based lateral boundary condition for CO               2               , resolving vertical and meridional gradients; and (3) a simple parameterization for biosphere-atmosphere fluxes that uses eddy covariance observations from the AmeriFlux network as prior estimates for fluxes. This framework allows quantitative comparison between the top-down constraint on fluxes from airborne observations of CO               2               with the bottom-up constraint of eddy flux measurements in a Bayesian synthesis inversion. The model is used to investigate the observed representation error (mismatch between point measurements and grid-cell-averaged values in models), evaluated in the companion paper, showing that unresolved spatial variability of surface fluxes gives rise to most of the representation error over the continent. Thus the representation error reflects the effect of aggregation errors. Discrepancies between simulated and observed CO               2               distributions are assessed to indicate where improvements are needed, including improved empirical representation of biosphere-atmosphere exchange process and better simulation of convective processes in atmospheric transport models.},

Anomalies in derived North American net ecosystem exchange (NEE) display strong but opposite correlations with surface air temperature between seasons, while their correlation with water availability was more constant throughout the year, such that water availability is the dominant control on annual NEE variability over North America. These results suggest that increased water availability and favorable temperature conditions (warmer spring and cooler summer) caused enhanced carbon uptake over North America near and during El Ni{\~n}o.},
