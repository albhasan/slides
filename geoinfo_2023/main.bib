  abstract = {While Brazil publicly committed to reduce deforestation in Amazonia at the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26), the Brazilian parliament is moving toward weakening environmental laws. Deforestation rates continue ascending, reaching in 2021 the highest value since 2006 (13,235 km2). To overcome this paradox, strategies to curb deforestation are mandatory. The current strategy, ``Plano Amaz\^onia 21/22,'' prioritizes law enforcement actions to curb illegal deforestation in only 11 Amazonian municipalities. Here, we show that this prioritization is likely to be insufficient since these municipalities account for just 37\% of the current deforestation rate. This strategy may also be undermined by the leakage of deforestation actions to unmonitored municipalities. Using a set of spatially explicit datasets integrated into a deforestation-prediction modeling approach, we propose a science-based alternative method for ranking deforestation hotspots to be prioritized by law enforcement actions. Our prioritization method accounts for more than 60\% of the deforestation, detecting larger deforested areas in both private and public lands, while covering 27\% less territory than ``Plano Amaz\^onia 21/22.'' Optimizing the detection of priority areas for curbing deforestation, as proposed here, is the first step to reducing deforestation rates and comply with the Brazilian legal commitment of 3925 km2 year-1.},

Like science, the development of good, reliable scientific software is a social process. A mature and growing community relies on the R software environment for carrying out geoscientific research. Here we describe why people use R and how it helps in communicating and reproducing research. R is a multiplatform open-source software environment R Development Core Team, 2012 that implements S, a language designed for data analysis. It provides low-level routines for data management tasks and linear algebra and high-level routines for fitting statistical models or creating complex graphs. The R engine is being developed by a small team called R core. R is extensible, and a set of more than 3500 add-on packages are being actively maintained by a similar number of developers.},

  abstract = {Turn your R code into packages that others can easily download and use. This practical book shows you how to bundle reusable R functions, sample data, and documentation together by applying author Hadley Wickham's package development philosophy. In the process, you'll work with devtools, roxygen, and testthat, a set of R packages that automate common development tasks. Devtools encapsulates best practices that Hadley has learned from years of working with this programming language. Ideal for developers, data scientists, and programmers with various backgrounds, this book starts you with the basics and shows you how to improve your package writing over time. You'll learn to focus on what you want your package to do, rather than think about package structure. Learn about the most useful components of an R package, including vignettes and unit tests. Automate anything you can, taking advantage of the years of development experience embodied in devtools. Get tips on good style, such as organizing functions into files. Streamline your development process with devtools. Learn the best way to submit your package to the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). Learn from a well-respected member of the R community who created 30 R packages, including ggplot2, dplyr, and tidyr},
