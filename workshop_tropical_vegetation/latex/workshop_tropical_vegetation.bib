  abstract = {Abstract                            We introduce Version 2 of our widely used 1-km K{\"o}ppen-Geiger climate classification maps for historical and future climate conditions. The historical maps (encompassing 1901--1930, 1931--1960, 1961--1990, and 1991--2020) are based on high-resolution, observation-based climatologies, while the future maps (encompassing 2041--2070 and 2071--2099) are based on downscaled and bias-corrected climate projections for seven shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs). We evaluated 67 climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) and kept a subset of 42 with the most plausible CO               2               -induced warming rates. We estimate that from 1901--1930 to 1991--2020, approximately 5\% of the global land surface (excluding Antarctica) transitioned to a different major K{\"o}ppen-Geiger class. Furthermore, we project that from 1991--2020 to 2071--2099, 5\% of the land surface will transition to a different major class under the low-emissions SSP1-2.6 scenario, 8\% under the middle-of-the-road SSP2-4.5 scenario, and 13\% under the high-emissions SSP5-8.5 scenario. The K{\"o}ppen-Geiger maps, along with associated confidence estimates, underlying monthly air temperature and precipitation data, and sensitivity metrics for the CMIP6 models, can be accessed at               www.gloh2o.org/koppen               .},

  abstract = {Sigmoidal and double-sigmoidal dynamics are commonly observed in many areas of biology. Here we present sicegar, an R package for the automated fitting and classification of sigmoidal and double-sigmoidal data. The package categorizes data into one of three categories, "no signal," "sigmoidal," or "double-sigmoidal," by rigorously fitting a series of mathematical models to the data. The data is labeled as "ambiguous" if neither the sigmoidal nor double-sigmoidal model fit the data well. In addition to performing the classification, the package also reports a wealth of metrics as well as biologically meaningful parameters describing the sigmoidal or double-sigmoidal curves. In extensive simulations, we find that the package performs well, can recover the original dynamics even under fairly high noise levels, and will typically classify curves as "ambiguous" rather than misclassifying them. The package is available on CRAN and comes with extensive documentation and usage examples.},
